# Ghoti.io Wave
Ghoti.io (*pronounced [fish](https://en.widipedia.org/wiki/Ghoti)*) Wave is a C++ HTTP server library.

It is not even alpha code at this point.  Don't use it unless you are trying
to develop the library itself.

## Goals:
To create a C++ HTTP library supporting HTTP1.1/2/3 as a simple API.
